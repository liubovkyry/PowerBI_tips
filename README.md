# Expert Data Modeling with Power BI - Second Edition
## Introduction to Data Modeling in Power BI

### Understanding the Power BI layers

  The following illustration shows a straightforward process we usually go through while building a report in Power BI Desktop:

We use different conceptual layers of Power BI to go through the preceding processes:
 - The Power Query (data preparation) layer
 - The Model layer (data model)
 - The Report layer (data visualization)
 
 The data preparation layer (Power Query)
 
In this layer, we get the data from various data sources, transform and cleanse that data, and make it available for the next layer. This is the first layer that touches the data, so it is an essential part of the data journey in Power BI. In the Power Query layer, we decide which queries load data into the data model and which ones take care of data transformation and data cleansing without loading the data into the data model

The data model layer

This layer has two views, the Data view and the Model view. In the Data view, we see the data being loaded; in the Model view, we see the data model, including the tables and their relationships.

The data visualization layer

In this layer, we bring the data to life by making meaningful and professional-looking data visualizations. The data visualization layer is accessible via the Report view, the default view in Power BI Desktop.

### How data flows in Power BI

Understanding how data flows during its journey in Power BI is vital. For instance, when we face an issue with some calculations in a report, we know how to analyze the root cause and trace the issue back to an actionable point. When we find an incorrect value in a line chart, and the line chart uses a measure dependent on a calculated column, we know that we do not find that calculated column in Power Query. The reason is that the objects we create in the data model are not accessible in Power Query. So, in that sense, we never look for a measure in the Power Query layer. We also do not expect to use custom functions created within Power Query in the data model layer.

### What data modeling means in Power BI

A well-designed data model in Power BI must be optimized for querying the data and reducing the dataset size by aggregating the data.

The best practice is to avoid importing everything from the data sources into Power BI and solving the related problems later such as performance issues, data model complexities, and having unnecessarily large data models. Instead, it is wise to get the data model right to precisely answer business-driven questions in the most performant way. When modeling data in Power BI, we must build a data model based on the business logic. So, we may need to join different tables and aggregate the data to a level that answers all business-driven questions, which can be tricky when we have data from various data sources of different grains.

### Building an efficient data model in Power BI

An efficient model must do the following:

 - Perform well (be fast)
 - Be business-driven
 - Decrease the complexity of the required DAX expressions (easy to understand)
 - Low maintenance (low cost)
 
Some related questions we might ask the business to optimize the performance of the report and avoid customer dissatisfaction:
 - Do we need to import all the columns from those tables?
 - Do we also need to import all data, or is just a portion of the data enough? For example, if the data source contains 10 years of data, does the business need to analyze all the historical data, or does bringing 1 or 2 years of data fit the purpose?
 Excel: Excel files with many formulas can be tricky data sources.
 - Does the business require you to analyze all the data contained in the all sheets? We may be able to exclude some of those sheets.
 - How often are the formulas edited? This is critical as modifying the formulas can easily break the data processing in Power Query and generate errors. It is best to replicate the Excel formulas in Power BI and load the raw data from Excel before the formulas are applied.

#### Star schema (dimensional modeling) and snowflaking
First things first, the star schema and dimensional modeling are the same things. In Power BI data modeling, the term star schema is more commonly used. The following sections are generic reminders about some star schema concepts.

#### Transactional modeling versus star schema modeling

In transactional systems, the main goal is improving the solutionâ€™s performance in creating new records and updating/deleting existing ones. So, when designing transactional systems, it is essential to go through the normalization process to decrease data redundancy and increase data entry performance by breaking the tables down into master-detail tables.

But the goal of a business analysis system is very different. In a business analysis solution, we need a data model optimized for querying in the most performant way.

Let us continue with a scenario. Suppose we have a transactional retail system for an international retail shop. We have hundreds of transactions every second from different parts of the world. The company owners want to see the total sales in the past 6 months.

This calculation sounds easy. It is just a simple SUM of sales. But wait, we have hundreds of transactions every second, right? If we have 100 transactions per second, then we have 8,640,000 transactions a day. So, for 6 months of data, we have more than 1.5 billion rows. Therefore, a simple SUM of sales takes a reasonable amount of time to process.

Now, the business raises a new request. The company owners now want to see the total sales in the past 6 months by country and city. They simply want to know what the best-selling cities are.

We need to add another condition to our simple SUM calculation, which translates into a join to the geography table. For those coming from a relational database design background, it is trivial that joins are relatively expensive operations. This scenario can go on and on. So, you can imagine how quickly a simple scenario turns into a rather tricky situation.

In the star schema, however, we already joined all those tables based on business entities. We aggregated and loaded the data into denormalized tables. In the preceding scenario, the business is not interested in seeing every transaction at the second level. So, summarizing the data at the day level decreases the row count from 1.5 billion to approximately 18,000 rows for the 6 months. Now you can imagine how fast the summation would run over 18,000 instead of 1.5 billion rows.

The idea of the star schema is to keep all numeric values in separate tables called fact tables and put all descriptive information into other tables called dimension tables. Usually, the fact tables are surrounded by dimensions explaining the facts. A data model with a fact table in the middle surrounded by dimensions looks like a star, which is why this modeling approach is called a star schema.

Snowflaking

Snowflaking is when we do not have a perfect star schema when dimension tables surround the fact tables. In some cases, we have some levels of descriptions stored in different tables. Therefore, some dimensions in the model are linked to other tables describing the dimensions in more detail. Snowflaking is normalizing the dimension tables. In some cases, snowflaking is inevitable; nevertheless, the general rule of thumb in data modeling in Power BI (when following a star schema) is to avoid snowflaking as much as possible to have a simpler and more performant model.

Understanding denormalization

In real-world scenarios, not everyone has the luxury of having a pre-built data warehouse designed in a star schema. In reality, snowflakes in data warehouse designs are inevitable. The data models are usually connected to various data sources, including transactional database systems and non-transactional data sources such as Excel files and CSV files. So, we almost always need to denormalize the model to a certain degree. Depending on the business requirements, we may have some normalization along with some denormalization. The reality is that there is no specific rule for the level of normalization and denormalization. The general rule of thumb is denormalizing the model, so each dimension describes all the related details as much as possible.

#### The iterative data modeling approach 

Taking advantage of an agile approach would be genuinely beneficial for Power BI development. Here is the iterative approach to follow in Power BI development:

Conducting discovery workshops

The Power BI development process starts with gathering information from the business by conducting discovery workshops to understand the requirements better. A business analyst may take care of this step in the real world, and many Power BI users are indeed business analysts. Whether we are business analysts or not, we are data modelers, so we need to analyze the information we receive from the business. We have to ask relevant questions that lead us toward various design possibilities. We have to identify potential risks, limitations, and associated costs and discuss them with the customer. After we get the answers, we can confidently take the next steps to design a data model that best covers the business requirements, mitigates the risks, and aligns with the technology limitations well.

Data preparation based on the business logic

We have a lot on our plate by now. We must get the data from multiple sources and go through the data preparation steps. Now that we have learned a lot about business logic, we can take the proper data preparation steps. For instance, if the business needs to connect to an OData data source and get a list of the columns required, we can prepare the data more efficiently with all the design risks and technology limitations in mind. After consciously preparing the data, we go to the next step, data modeling.

Data modeling

If we properly go through the previous steps, we can build the model more efficiently. We need to think about the analytical side of things while considering all the business requirements, design possibilities, risks, and technology limitations. For instance, if the business cannot tolerate data latency longer than 5 minutes, we may need to consider using DirectQuery. Using DirectQuery comes with some limitations and performance risks. So, we must consider the design approach that satisfies the business requirements the most. We cover DirectQuery in Chapter 4, Getting Data from Various Sources, in the Dataset storage modes section.

Testing the logic

One of the most trivial and yet most important steps in data modeling is testing all the business logic we implement to meet the requirements. Not only do we need to test the figures to ensure the results are accurate, but we also need to test the solution from a performance and user experience perspective. Be prepared for tons of mixed feedback and sometimes strong criticism from the end users, especially when we think everything is OK.

Demonstrating the business logic in basic data visualizations

As we are modeling the data, we do not need to worry about data visualization. Confirming with the business SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) is the fastest way to ensure all the reporting logic is correct. The fastest way to get confirmation from SMEs is to demonstrate the logic in the simplest possible way, such as using table and matrix visuals and some slicers on the page. When demonstrating the solution to SMEs, do not forget to highlight that the visualization is only to confirm the reporting logic with them and not the actual product delivery. In the real world, we have many new discussions and surprises during the demonstration sessions, which usually means we are at the beginning of the second iteration, so we start gathering information about the required changes and the new requirements, if any.

We gradually become professional data modelers as we go through the preceding steps several times. This book also follows an iterative approach, so we go back and forth between different chapters to cover some scenarios.

## Data Analysis eXpressions (DAX)

### Understanding virtual tables
Whenever we use a DAX function that results in a table of values, we are creating a virtual table.
When generating or loading the data from other tables, taking some table operations and loading the results into a calculated table, we probably created a virtual table first, then populated the calculated table with the results. 

#### Creating a calculated table
We want to create a calculated table and name it Sequential Numbers with an ID column. The ID column values are sequential numbers between 1 and 20, increasing by one step in each row:

 - Open a new Power BI Desktop instance.
 - Click New table from the Modeling tab.
 - Type the following DAX expression, then press Enter:

```Sequential Numbers = GENERATESERIES(1, 20, 1)
```

The GENERATESERIES() function generates values for us. The output is a desirable table, but we need to do one last operation to rename the Values column to ID.

- Replace the previous expression with the following expression, then press Enter:

```Sequential Numbers =
SELECTCOLUMNS(
    GENERATESERIES(1, 20, 1)
    , "ID"
    , [Value]
    )
 ```
    
    In the preceding scenario, we used a virtual table to create a calculated table. In the following scenario, we demonstrate the usage of virtual tables in a measure.

 ####  Using virtual tables in a measure â€“ Part 1

Create a measure in the Internet Sales table to calculate the quantities ordered for products when their list price is higher than $1,000. Name the measure Orders with List Price Bigger than or Equal to $1,000:

```
Orders with List Price Bigger than or Equal to $1,000 =
CALCULATE(
    SUM('Internet Sales'[OrderQuantity])
        , FILTER('Product' //Virtual table start
            , 'Product'[List Price]>=1000
                ) //Virtual table end
        )
```

 - We created a virtual table using the FILTER() function on top of the Product table to get only the products with a List Price value bigger than or equal to $1,000. All columns from the Product tables are available in this virtual table, which lives in memory. It is only available within the Orders with List Price Bigger than or Equal to $1,000 measure and nowhere else in the data model.
 - The SUM() function then calculates the summation of the OrderQuantity from the Internet Sales table.
 
 #### Using virtual tables in a measure â€“ Part 2
 
Using the same sample file used in the previous scenario, create a measure in the Internet Sales table to calculate quantities that the customers ordered more than 4 products with a list price bigger than $1,000. Name the measure Order Qty for Customers Buying More than 4 Products with List Price Bigger Than $1,000.

To solve this scenario, we need to create a virtual table of customers with more than 4 orders for products that cost more than $1,000. The following code will take care of that:

```
Order Qty for Customers Buying More than 4 Product with List Price Bigger Than $1,000 =
SUMX(
    FILTER(
        VALUES(Customer[CustomerKey]) //Virtual table
        , [Orders with List Price Bigger than or Equal $1,000] > 4
        )
    , [Orders with List Price Bigger than or Equal $1,000]
    )
    
 ```

Analyzing the preceding calculation helps us to understand the power of virtual tables much better:

 - The virtual table here has only one column, which is CustomerKey. Remember, this column is only accessible within the current calculation.
 - Then, we use the FILTER() function to filter the results of VALUES() only to show the customer keys that have more than 4 orders for products with a list price of more than $1,000.
 - Last, we sum all those quantities for the results of FILTER().

As stated earlier, we can use all DAX functions that return a table value to create virtual tables. However, the functions in the following table are the most common ones:
